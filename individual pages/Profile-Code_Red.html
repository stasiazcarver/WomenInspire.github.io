            <p>CODE RED for gender justice!</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
            <p>CODE RED for gender justice! is a feminist collective that has existed for 10 years, it aims to bring a light to a wider diversity of critical feminist voices  from the Caribbean. Starting as a student group at the University of West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, this group has grown into a multi-national non-governmental organisation, that supports feminist activism across the Caribbean. </p>
            <p>They have held events such as the ‘New Perspectives Graduate Symposium’ series to encourage feminist scholars in the Caribbean. They have organised events such as the ‘CatchAFyah Feminist Grounding’, which they describe as being the ‘region’s first ever young feminist meet-up’. This event also spurred the creation of the ‘CatchAFyah Caribbean Feminist Network’.</p>
