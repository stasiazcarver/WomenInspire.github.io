        <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Women Without Borders</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
           <p>Edit Schlaffer is a social scientist, writer, activist and holds a PhD from the University of Vienna. In 2002 she founded Women Without Borders.</p>

           <p>Women Without Borders is an advocacy and research organisation for women around the globe. It brings together courageous and determined women to create a new female security paradigm, i.e. empowering women to counter violent extremism. They advocate for "a future without fear, suppression and violence." The organisation encourages women to become active participants in their communities, to co-shape their present and their future. Women Without Borders promotes the role of women in the security sphere and sensitises mothers in particular to their role and responsibility to challenge violent extremist ideologies.</p>

        <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>Women Without Borders is based in Vienna, Austria.</p>
