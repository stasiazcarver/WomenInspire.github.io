        <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Guerilla Girls</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
            <p>In 1984, an exhibition surveying what were said to be the most significant artists in painting and sculpture opened at The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). Of those exhibited, 13 of the 169 artists were women and all the artists were white, European or American. This represented the pervasive inequalities in the art world and led a group of women artists to create Guerilla Girls.</p>
            <p>The Guerrilla Girls are a collective of feminist activist artists, who don gorilla masks for anonymity and create art that seeks to ‘expose gender and ethnic bias as well as corruption in politics, art, film, and pop culture’. They have used their platform to demand change and ask provocative questions like ‘do women have to be naked to get into the met.museum?’ a line that is screenprinted in their artwork alongside  the statistic, ‘less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female’. For over 30 years the groups has confronted inequalities through art, sharing their works across the world.</p>

        <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>The group started in New York in 1984 and now works worldwide.</p>
