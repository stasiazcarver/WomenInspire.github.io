        <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Sisters Uncut</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
            <p>In the aftermath of the 2012 gang rape and consequent death of Jyoti Singh on a bus in the Indian capital New Deli, protests erupted nationwide and one of the voices that rung the loudest was Kavita Krishnan. In her speech that went viral decrying Indian respectability politics, Krishnan infamously said ‘We believe that regardless of whether she is indoors or outside, whether it is day or night, for whatever reason, however, she may be dressed — women have a right to freedom. And that freedom without fear is what we need to protect, to guard and respect.’</p>
            <p>She is a leader in India's Communist Party and Secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association. She was the driving force behind a series of protests that eventually led to the Criminal Law Amendment in 2013, that reformed existing laws on rape in India.</p>
